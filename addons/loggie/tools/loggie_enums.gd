## a higher-than-configured log level will result in nothing happening.

	PLAIN, ## Prints will be plain text.
	ANSI,  ## Prints will be styled using the ANSI standard. Compatible with Powershell, Win CMD, etc.
	BBCODE, ## Prints will be styled using the Godot BBCode rules. Compatible with the Godot console.
	MARKDOWN, ## Prints will be styled using the Markdown standard. Compatible with most Markdown readers.

	## figure out a class name for the class that called a loggie function,
	## and append it to the outputted message.

enum BoxCharactersMode {
	COMPATIBLE, ## Boxes are drawn using characters that compatible with any kind of terminal or text reader.
	PRETTY ## Boxes are drawn using special unicode characters that create a prettier looking box which may not display properly in some terminals or text readers.
}

## Defines a list of possible approaches that can be taken to derive some kind of a class name proxy from a script that doesn't have a 'class_name' clause.
enum NamelessClassExtensionNameProxy {
	NOTHING, ## If there is no class_name, nothing will be displayed.
	SCRIPT_NAME, ## Use the name of the script whose class_name we tried to read. (e.g. "my_script.gd").
	BASE_TYPE, ## Use the name of the base type which the script extends (e.g. 'Node2D', 'Control', etc.)
}

## Defines a list of possible behaviors for the 'show_loggie_specs' setting.
enum ShowLoggieSpecsMode {
	DISABLED, ## Loggie specs won't be shown.
	ESSENTIAL, ## Show only the essentials.
	ADVANCED ## Show all loggie specs.
}

## Defines a list of possible outcomes that can happen when attempting to log a message.
enum LogAttemptResult {
	SUCCESS, ## Message will be logged successfully.
	LOG_LEVEL_INSUFFICIENT, ## Message won't be logged because it was output at a log level higher than what Loggie is currently set to.
	DOMAIN_DISABLED, ## Message won't be logged because it was outputted from a disabled domain.
	INVALID_CHANNEL, ## Message won't be logged because the channel which was supposed to send it doesn't exist.
	WRONG_ENVIRONMENT, ## Message won't be logged because the environment the output is being requested from is not compatible with the environment this message is configured to be outputted in.
}

## Defines a list of possible ways to configure Loggie to check for updates.
enum UpdateCheckType {
	DONT_CHECK, ## If the user doesn't want Loggie to check for updates at all.
	CHECK_AND_SHOW_MSG, ## If the user wants Loggie to check for updates, and display info in a terminal message.
	CHECK_DOWNLOAD_AND_SHOW_MSG, ## If the user wants Loggie to check for updates, download the update, and display info in a terminal message.
	CHECK_AND_SHOW_UPDATER_WINDOW, ## If the user wants Loggie to check for updats, and display the updater window.
}

## Defines a lists of possible environments in which a [LoggieMsg] can be outputted.
enum MsgEnvironment {
	BOTH, ## The message will be outputted both in-engine (tool scripts) and when the project is running.
	ENGINE, ## The message will be outputted only in-engine (tool scripts).
	RUNTIME, ## The message will be outputted only when the project is running.
