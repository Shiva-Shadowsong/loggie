config/description="Loggie is a basic logging utility for those who could use a couple of improvements and more control over how console and logfile output is styled and handled. It makes it a breeze to compose and print messages with all the extra data you need to have helpful logs.

Loggie takes care that your logs always look clean in release builds, while allowing you to use extra styling for console targeted output. ANSI-compatible, and friendly both for solo developers and developers in a team (externally loaded settings for each developer).

If you need something simple but effective, Loggie is your guy."
